# ecomm-backend

First I ran npm i to download the necessary packages since I didn't see the node_modules folder. Then, I went into the models folder and edited the columns with the requirements in the README. I referred back to the documentation when references to different tables were needed since I didn't know how to do that. Then, I moved onto the index.js in the models folder to add the associations of the different models. I got everything except didn't really know what to put inside the foreign_key key. After going over the foreign_key and few other things with my tutor, it helped me understand a little more. After doing my routes, I started to test them in Insomnia putting in requests. I think I got everything except creating a product.
